## 1. WHAT IS EASYRESEARCH

EasyResearch (branded "Easier") is a sub-app living under `/easyresearch/*` within the larger True-Easier-Research platform. It is a full-stack ESM/EMA research platform where researchers create surveys, manage participants, collect longitudinal data, and analyze responses. It supports one-time surveys AND multi-day longitudinal/ESM studies with scheduled prompts, consent flows, screening, participant types, and a configurable mobile app layout.

- **Stack:** React 18, TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Edge Functions) — all tables live in the `care_connector` schema
- **Mobile:** Capacitor for native iOS/Android push notifications
- **State:** React hooks and local state only (no Redux or React Query)
- **Drag-and-drop:** `@hello-pangea/dnd` and `@dnd-kit/core`
- **Entry point:** Routes defined in `src/App.tsx` under the EASYRESEARCH PLATFORM ROUTES section
- **Development stage ai api key: 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 use google/gemma-3-27b-it to save my fucking money

## 5. RESEARCH PROJECT 

Every study lives in the `research_project` table. and all layout information is stored in research_project.app_layout, no other file used or should be used

## 6. USER PROFILE

User role is defined in profile table


## 7. USER ROLE

user role is defined in profile table's is_researcher toggle is_participant toggle, a users can be both, this should not overide if a user can sumbit or can join a research, a user can be both researcher and a participant (join another researcher's research), the actual dashboard display logic is defined by user setting what he wants to get displayed



## 8. QUESTIONNAIRE 

Each questionnaire is a row in the `questionnaire` table in the `care_connector` schema. It belongs to one project and has a type field that determines its purpose:

- **survey** — A regular questionnaire with questions, schedule, frequency (once, daily, hourly, etc.), active time window, estimated duration, notification toggle, and Do Not Disturb settings.
- **consent** — A consent form with consent text and consent URL fields. The participant must agree before proceeding.
- **screening** — A screening questionnaire containing questions that determine participant eligibility. Questions can have a disqualify value in their config that auto-rejects participants.

REMEMBER NOT to use a seperate consent of screening table,they are also defined as questionnaire in this project

Questionnaires are linked to participant types through the `questionnaire_participant_type` junction table — a many-to-many relationship. A questionnaire can be assigned to multiple participant types, and a participant type can have multiple questionnaires.



## 9. QUESTIONS

Each question is a row in the `survey_question` table. It belongs to one project and optionally to one questionnaire via the `questionnaire_id` FK column.

## 10. PARTICIPANT TYPES 

Each participant type is a row in the `participant_type` table. It belongs to one project and defines a category of participant (e.g., "Primary Caregiver", "Family Member").

all questionaires and questions can be configured to be shown to what participant type

## 11. Layout and design

There are only two layouts for this project, 1) desktop layout, for all desktop screen sizes, whether small or large; and we are using only one header, one footer, one siderbar for the entire desktop layout, the header and footer should be displayed on all public pages, and the sidebar should be displayed on all dashboard pages, 2) mobile layout, for all mobile and tablet screen sizes; and we are using only one mobile header, one mobile footer for all mobile pages, and they should persist on all pages, whether it's a research project or not
